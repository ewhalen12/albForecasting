### Motivation
This project aims to build a spatiotemporal model of the Asian Longhorn Beetle (ALB), an invasive species in Massachusetts.  Native to China and Korea, the ALB was first de-tected  in  New  York  in  1996  and  subsequently  found  in  several  cities,  including  Chicago ,Philadelphia, Toronto, and Boston. The largest infestation in North America is currentlyin Worcester, MA. ALB larvae kill their host tree and pose a major threat to the forestsof New England. Predicting spatial and temporal ALB distributions in Massachusetts is acritical first step to designing mitigation strategies.
